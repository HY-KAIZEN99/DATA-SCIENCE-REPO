ðŸ“Š Key Insights:
Gender Distribution:

Male laureates dominate the Nobel Prizes across all decades and categories.

Female winners represent a small but increasing proportionâ€”notably rising from the 1990s onward.

Top Countries by Birth: The United States leads with the highest number of Nobel laureates (291), followed by the United Kingdom and Germany. This reflects historic dominance in global scientific and academic research.

Most Awarded Categories: Physics, Chemistry, and Medicine have the highest number of laureates. Peace and Literature also show steady recognition, with Peace often awarded to groups or organizations.

Trend Over Time (Decade): There is a steady increase in the number of laureates per decade, especially after World War II. The U.S. dominance becomes more pronounced in the 20th century, especially post-1950.

Proportion of Female Winners by Category: Peace and Literature have relatively higher female representation than technical fields like Physics and Economics. Physics and Economics show the lowest female participation, highlighting gender disparity in STEM.

Repeat Winners: A few individuals (e.g., Marie Curie, Linus Pauling) have won more than once. These are rare and prestigious cases, often recognized for contributions across multiple domains.
